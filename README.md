# Dynamic Programming
*Those who  can't remember their past are condemned to repeat it.*

### Where to apply?
 1. Optimal substructure
 2. Overlapping subproblems

<hr/> 

### Top-down approach: Recursion+Memoisation
### Bottom-up approach: Iterative approach in a bottom up manner

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(n)

## Fibonacci
 * <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/01-fib.cpp">Top down</a>
 * <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/02-fib%20bottom%20up.cpp">Bottom up</a>
 * <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/fib%20space%20and%20time%20optimized.cpp">Space and time optimized

## <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/03-%20reduce%20number%20to%20one%20in%20min%20steps.cpp">Minimum steps to one</a>
 * Top down
 * Bottom up

## Coins change
 * Top down
 * Bottom up

*In one year you have to sell one bottle (from extreme last or first of the given array). Prices of bottle increases every year. (price*year)*

## <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Dynamic-Programming/tree/master">Maximum subarray sum</a>
 * In this, we can do space optimization as well. (Kadaen's algo)
